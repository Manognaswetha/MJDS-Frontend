                    Jewellery (or jewelry in AmE) consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment, such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks. <br><br>

                    Humans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons: <br><br>
<ul>
<li> functional, generally to fix clothing or hair in place.
<li>as a marker of social status and personal status, as with a wedding ring
<li>as a signifier of some form of affiliation, whether ethnic, religious or social
<li>to provide talismanic protection
<li>as a carrier or symbol of personal meaning â€“ such as love, mourning, a personal milestone or even luck
</ul>
